## Version 0.1
#### Description
Version 0.1 is the starting point of the Calculator Project. You must create the base structure and styles, using bootstrap as you deem necessary. For this version we are looking to see that you
understand how to create the basic structure of a web application, style it, and make it reasonably responsive.  No functionality will be encoded with this version.

## Getting Started
> - Have you forked the repo from the LearningFuze account?
        - **Yes** - continue to next step
        - **No** - Fork from the Learningfuze Repo to your account
        - **I don't know** - Look at **your** github account and see if you can find the appropriate repo there.
        
- Have you cloned it from **your** repo to your local system?
        - **Yes** - continue to next step
        - **No** 
            - Go to your LFZ folder. 
            - use `git clone [repo address]` to make a local copy on your development machine.
        - **I don't know** - If you have a copy, use `git remote -v` to see what address it came from.  If it is from the LearningFuze account you cloned the **wrong repo**.  If it is your address you have it right.  If there is no copy, you haven't cloned it yet!
        
- Are you in the right folder?

        - **Yes** - You are in the folder named after the repo you cloned, go to next step
        - **No** - You are most likely still in your LFZ folder where you cloned from. Change directories to the repo folder.
        - **I don't know** - type `pwd` and press enter.  If you don't see the right folder, use `cd [folder name]` till you get to the right folder.  Use `cd ..` to go backwards a step in your folder structure, if necessary.
- Are you on your master branch?
    - **Yes** - continue to "Pull Latest Changes"
    - **I dont know** Run the command below
        - `git branch` - this will highlight the branch you are currently on
    - **No** - Make sure you `git add .` and `git commit` to your current branch before you switch to your master branch
> - Pull Latest Changes
        - `git checkout master`
        - `git pull origin master` - **Now continue with the next steps**
> - Create a feature branch
    - `git checkout -b v0.1`
> - Work on the scope defined <a href="https://github.com/Learning-Fuze/SGT/tree/v.1#scope">Below</a>
> - Add files to git
    - `git add .`
> - Commit files (Group files together)
    - `git commit -m "SGT v0.1 - Your Name"`
    - **Replace "Your Name" with your first and last name**
> - Send to gitHub (Push)
    - `git push origin v0.1`
> - Create pull request
    - Pull request should be made from v0.1 to **your repository's/teams** master branch


## Scope

        - 9 numeric keys: 0 through 9
        - 4 arithmetic function: -, +, *, /
        - equation buttons: =
        - 2 clear buttons: C (Clear), and CE (Clear Everything/All)
        - 1 display area for calculations / results
- Styling:
        - Apply whatever styling method you choose.  You can use standard CSS or Bootstrap
        - Calculator should be relatively responsive between mobile and desktop
