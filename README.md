# Calculator
The calculator is an application that I found to very helpful in understand how Javascript works. This application help me realize how a computer thinks, and resulted in me improving my Javascript skills. In addition to being able to handle basic, comprehensive, and advanced operations, the calculator is also capable of converting currencies and measurements.

The logic for converting measurements is embedded within logic of the calculator. The exchange rates are up-to date as they are requested asynchronously through an API. AngularJS was used to control the view and request the business logic for the business logic for the exchange rate conversion. Javascript was used for the logic behind the calculator.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Material Design Bootstrap
- AngularJS
