## Version 0.1
#### Description
Version 0.1 is the starting point of the Calculator Project. You must create the base structure and styles, using bootstrap as you deem necessary. For this version we are looking to see that you
understand how to create the basic structure of a web application, style it, and make it reasonably responsive.  No functionality will be encoded with this version.
